# Pokemon Trade

Pokemon Trade (WIP) is a personal project makes easy for the pokemon community to trade pokemon.

The main goal of the project is to replace the necessity of pokemon player to create account on forums and other places to find some one to trade. It will work like a marketplace, the user register the pokemon their *For Trade* (FT) and their *Looking For* (LF) pokemon, and the site will match their needs with their offers.

Pokemon Trade (WIP) is in a really early stage, all the front is to prepare the front-back connection and check for security vulnerabilities.
